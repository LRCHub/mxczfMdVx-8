[Genius]
Can you tell me what's going on?
Help me!
[Twin spirit n. 32]
Please don't bother me
'Cause i was born
A few minutes before
You and i really don't know
What's going on
And where we're going
To leave for
[Genius]
Hey! but it's the same!
Can you hear that?
[Twin spirit n. 32] what?
[Genius] the same incredible experience i had
It is the same...

[Genius & twin spirit n. 32] sure!
[Genius] when early today lying in bed
I felt that crazy sensation in me!
[Twin spirit n. 32] boy! i'm going mad
So listen please!
Yes... that's the sequence that we use to knock
On the gate that led us to mc chaos kingdom
You have just been admitted here
Through that gate, so please don't be silly now with me!
[Genius] wow! what a big mess i can't explain
I hope that this will be
Only a funny dream but if it's not
I want to know!
Can you please tell me more about this crazy world!

[Twin spirit n. 32] we're twin spirits of the humans that
Suddenly started sleeping
Mine is a boy called genius
I hold the key to his dreams and yours?
What's your human's name?
[Genius &twin spirit n. 32] mc chaos kingdom?
What the hell is that!
Mc chaos kingdom?
What the hell is that!
[Genius] i didn't knock on that kingdom's gate
I am genius!
[Genius & twin spirit n. 32] what a dangerous paradox
Paradox, dangerous paradox!

[Twin spirit n. 32] oh... please come on!
You're surely wrong
A human can't come to
This secret kingdom
Thirty three stop!
I won't go on
Witch your requests
I'm getting nervous,
I won't listen to your talks!
Prepare yourself
There's no much time
Within a few minutes we're
In our working desk!
[Genius] man! please tell me why
You've got to offend
An honest person that is
Asking you help!
[Twin spirit n. 32] ok! if you're honest
Then tell me what
You're dreaming at the moment
[Genius] thanks! you're really a friend!
I'm really amazed!
Really amazed by all
Your faith but anyway...
I'm dreaming of being suspended
Floating in a cloudy wide space
And slowly attending a long queue
Of people walking slowly ahead
There's no ground all around everything
Seems to be like in a romance
In front of me this man keeps
Telling me saying he's my twin spirit!
[Twin spirit n. 32] oh... that's really great
Just let me check 'cause i really don't care
About your tales and i'll tell you soon
What kind of lie i have heard
Now i can see in my memory
My owner's dreaming of a cloudy wide space
I can see him attending a long queue
Of people slowly walking
Yeah! right!
Oh my god the same view!
I'm afraid you are telling the truth!
What a mess i think you are my owner!
Maybe you are really genius
[Genius] you got it finally!
[Twin spirit n. 32] but genius... how did you get here!

[Twin spirit n. 32] we're twin spirits of the humans that
Suddenly started sleeping
Mine is a boy called genius
I hold the key to his dreams and yours?
What's your human's name?
[Genius &twin spirit n. 32] mc chaos kingdom?
What the hell is that!
Mc chaos kingdom?
What the hell is that!
[Genius] i didn't knock on that kingdom's gate
I am genius!
[Genius & twin spirit n. 32] what a dangerous paradox
Paradox, dangerous paradox!

[Twin spirit n. 32] i guess that your mind was listening to
That strange clock sequence
While this morning you were
In a sort of sleeping state
You must have created
A magic connection
Between dreams and reality...
Your imagination has
Probably directed
That sound to the kingdom gate

[Twin spirit n. 32] we're twin spirits of the humans that
Suddenly started sleeping
[Genius] i didn't knock on that kingdom's gate
[Twin spirit n. 32] mine is a boy called genius
I hold the key to his dreams!
[Genius] i told you i'm genius
[Genius & twin spirit n. 32] what a dangerous paradox
Paradox, paradox, dangerous paradox!

[Well, you probably didn't imagine that when humans start to dream, the adventures, the great fantasies, that they experienced are caused and controlled by their assigned twin spirit. this twin spirit is a sort of guide created to handle the dremaers minds, making them live what they dream as if it was true. but, under normal circumstances they shouldn't see him and they shouldn't even know about his existence. when created, to be admitted, the twin spirits knock at the gates of the dreams kingdom with a particular beat sequence that works as a password. causally, the genius clock alarm beated exactly the same sequence, and, being a drummer himself, he started to imagine in his mind a snare drum pattern that followed that beat. he was not completely awaken and the snare beats he was imaging of reached the dream kingdom gate, and he was wrongly admittend in that parallel dimension by the doorkeepers considered as a regular twin spirit! ]
