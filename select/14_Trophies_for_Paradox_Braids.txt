He came in
Like a winner
Strong and slim
Trophies in his grin
I can see him taking wind
Of what it would be like to lie with me
To lie with me

Can you take me?
He came in
Like a sinner
Small and grim
Trophies to the wind
He can see me wondering
Of what it has been like to lie to me
(This winter)
To not come home to me
(This winter)
To grow cold towards me
(This winter)
To feel annoyed of me
(This winter)

Can you take me higher?
There is nothing finer
Feel my desire
Our love is my fire

Can you take me higher?
There was nothing finer
In me there's desire
Our love was my fire
